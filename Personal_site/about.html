        <p>It all started in my college dorm with the idea of trying to cut through all of the garbage out there about getting rich. We hope to simplify this prosses for anyone who is interested in helping themselves.

        <h2 class="move">Why it Matters</h2>
        <p class="move">I believe in helping young men who often feel neglected and overlooked in a world that can be indifferent to their struggles. My primary motivation for wanting to help them is that every person deserves a chance to reach their full potential, regardless of the obstacles they may face. Young men, in particular, can face unique challenges that may prevent them from realizing their goals and dreams. By offering resources, guidance, and support, we can help these young men overcome the obstacles they face and achieve their full potential. It is my belief, that by helping these young men, we can create a more just and equitable society for all.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>As Robin Williams once said, "No matter what people tell you, words and ideas can change the world." With this in mind, the goal of our podcast is to make a positive difference in the life of at least one person. While we recognize that our reach may be limited, we believe that even a single act of kindness, one word of encouragement, or a single piece of helpful advice can have a profound impact on someone's life. Through our podcast, we hope to inspire, inform, and support our listeners in ways that make a meaningful difference in their lives. Whether it's providing practical tips for personal growth or sharing inspiring stories of triumph over adversity, our goal is to make a positive impact, one listener at a time. As Robin Williams recognized, even the smallest actions can have a ripple effect that changes the world, and we hope that our podcast will be a part of that change.</p>
