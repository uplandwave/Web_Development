        On this page we will have general information about the podcast and some quick links to direct 
        those interested to where to find the show. This page will also act as the portal to all other pages.

        Here we will have detals about the avalable episodes and a descripton of each epiosde. Viewers will 
        be able to go to the episode and listen.

        Info on the other pages in detail.
        Here are my 600
        Why do people come to my site? 
        People come to my site because the want to learn more about the podcast. 

        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer?
        I have thought of a few thoughts I would have if I was serching up another podcast's website.
        1. I would like to learn a little bit more about the creation to the podcast, and more detail about the why behind their podcast.
        2. I would like to know about their posting schedule and when new episodes were droping.
        3. I would like to have a place to get to all of their episodes and their description.
        4. I might be trying to find specific info about a particular episode.
        And thats about it. I would be expecting a real simple and easy to navigate site without a lot of fluf so I could get around quick.

        What types of activities will you visitors want to do on the site?
        I would think the bigest motivation to visit the site would be for them to learn about the podcast. Its likley that they listen to the show elswhere and they are 
        just trying to learn more or maybe find information on specific episodes.

        What info is needed to do all of the things visitors might want to do?
        I will need a lot of information on the podcast; namely info on each episode, releace times, background, and where to listen.

        Why would visitors come to my site insted of going elcewehre?
        They would come to me for the information they can not get from the streaming platform. This particular podcast is stll small and no one elce would ever think to 
        make a webste for it. That stated I am absolutly confident my site will be the only one on the entire internet with this amout of detail on a podcast hoasted out 
        of my dorm room here in small town Rexburg ID.
